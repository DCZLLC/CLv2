**Additional Details:**
In the upcoming Cryptoluck v2.0.0.0 update, we are introducing a new Halving System to enhance the overall economic model of the cryptocurrency. Here's a breakdown of how the halving system works:

**Initial Subsidy (First 86,000 Blocks):**
Miners will receive a fixed subsidy of 500 COIN for each block mined during the initial period.

**First Halving (Blocks 86,000 to 126,000):**
After the first 86,000 blocks, the subsidy will undergo the first halving event.
The subsidy will be reduced to 250 COIN for each block mined within the range of blocks 86,000 to 126,000.

**Second Halving (Blocks 126,000 to 136,000):**
Following the first halving, there will be a second halving event.
Miners will receive 25% less subsidy, resulting in 187.50 COIN for each block mined within the range of blocks 126,000 to 136,000.

**Subsequent Halvings (Blocks 136,000 Onward):**
After the second halving, the subsidy will continue to reduce by 5% every 15,000 blocks.
This reduction will occur for each successive halving event.

**Post-Mining Era (Blocks 650,000 Onward):**
Beyond block 650,000, the subsidy will be set to 0, indicating the end of new block rewards.
Miners will then rely on transaction fees as their primary incentive.

This halving mechanism is designed to control the total supply of Cryptoluck and bring about a gradual transition from block rewards to transaction fees, promoting sustainability and scarcity within the ecosystem. Get ready for these exciting changes with Cryptoluck v2.0.0.0! 🚀💎
